# Rossenblatt's Perceptron demonstration

#### Note
> I've made a lot of projects on my GitHub previously, that are now privated due to the fact that they didn't meet my quality standards, including this one. For the educational purposes, I am leaving this one on public.

## What's this?
This repo contains a Python-based implementation of single-layer artificial neuron (Rosenblatt's Perceptron) in a well-described Jupyter Notebook. **I hope it helps someone who wants to start exploring Deep-Learning algorithms.**
